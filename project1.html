                        I created an interactive interface through React using 
                        interactive interface components. I wanted to look at 
                        creating a clothing selection similar to online shopping 
                        websites that have a favorite items list that users can 
                        add items to while they are browsing. Additionally, my 
                        interface will be designed to have the ability to filter 
                        by type of clothing and color, as well as sort by price 
                        or alphabetically.

                    <p>
                        I replicated my favorite features 
                        from some of my most frequented online shopping 
                        websites, using <b>React</b> to design a shopping 
                        site where the user can add items to their 
                        "Favorites" list and filter through different 
                        clothing options.

                        To start, I completed a competitive analysis to 
                        determine what I liked and didn't like about the "add to favorites"
                        feature from three of my most frequented online shopping websites:

                        I analyzed the "favorite" feature on all three websites to create
                        the competitve comparison chart below:

                    <p>
                        I identified the following features I wanted to include 
                        in my design to ease the process of adding an item to favorites:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Visible button to click to add to favorites list that changes when the item is in the list</li>
                            <li>Obivious Remove button for the list</li>
                            <li>Organize additions from least recent to most recent</li>

                    <p>
                        I started with a <b>sketch</b> to plan what I wanted the 
                        interface to look like. Based off of the three websites I examined earlier, 
                        I wanted to make sure that the functionality of elements 
                        on the screen were <b>clear</b> to the user. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Key features that I knew I had to include were: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                two filtering categories 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                at least one sorting feature
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                an aggregaor
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                a reset button to remove filters and sorts
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                items that have a visible button to add them to the favorites list
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I used <b>React components</b> to create the filtering and 
                        sorting, as well as creating an item list that holds 
                        the items added to the favorites list. I then added the 
                        functionality in the app by creating functions to handle 
                        the changes made by pressing buttons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to make the functionality of each button on the 
                        screen clear to each user, I made sure to add <b>labels</b> 
                        that could guide the user through the interface. 
                    </p>
