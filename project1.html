                        I created an interactive interface through React using 
                        interactive interface components. I wanted to look at 
                        creating a clothing selection similar to online shopping 
                        websites that have a favorite items list that users can 
                        add items to while they are browsing. Additionally, my 
                        interface will be designed to have the ability to filter 
                        by type of clothing and color, as well as sort by price 
                        or alphabetically.

                        I replicated my favorite features 
                        from some of my most frequented online shopping 
                        websites, using <b>React</b> to design a shopping 
                        site where the user can add items to their 
                        "Favorites" list and filter through different 
                        clothing options.

                        I analyzed the "favorite" feature on all three websites to create

                        This process allowed me to gain valuable insights on how to use
                        React and create an interactive display that dynamically interacts
                        with items on the screen related to filters and sorting options
                        applied, as well as adding things to their favorites list. Using
                        React proved to be useful in handling different functionalities
                        of features. This process led to valuable insights on front-end 
                        engineering that will allow me to better collaborate with different 
                        teams of designers and developers in the future.
