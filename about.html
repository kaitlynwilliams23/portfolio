                            After that, I <b>fell in love</b> with the challenges of 
                            coding, and learned that I could <b>combine my passion

                                    the more real to me after I <b>tore my ACL</b> during my senior season in Fall 2023. 
                                    I have spent an extended amount of 
                                    time in the training room rehabilitating my knee, 
                                    learning a significant amount about the difference

                                    what factors can predict the timing and cause of an

                                    prevent the injury altogether. The growing field of
