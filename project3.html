                        Partiful is a new events platform and party RSVP website. 
                        It offers tools to create, customize, and share event 
                        invitations, allowing hosts to manage RSVPS, track guest 
                        lists, and communicate with attendees without having to 
                        keep someone's number. With a user-friendly interface, 
                        Partiful aims to make organizing parties and events more 
                        straightforward and enjoyable.

                    <p>
                        We were very excited to work with Partiful considering that every member
                        of our group has used the interface to invite people to events. Having 
                        some experience with this program allowed us to explore some creative
                        ideas we had to improve one of our favorite party invitation platforms.

                        Our iterative design process for this client can be outlined by the following steps:

                          <li>
                            Individually creating sketches of low-fidelity wireframes

                          <li>
                            Collaborating to settle on a design for our first round of low-fidelity wireframes

                          Inability to see more than one or two events on the homepage at a time (limited surface area of h-scroll)

                          <li>
                          The difficulty of using h-scroll for every element on their homepage

                          <li>
                          The lack of content on the homepage other than events to bring

                        Once we established the main painpoints of Partiful's 
                        homepage in the eyes of its designers, we individually 
                        created sketches of the low-fidelity wireframe for the 
                        homepage, as seen below. Use the arrows at the bottom of 
                        the Figma display to scroll through some of our different

                        I got some of my main inspiration from Netflix in its 
                        categorial h-scroll with the ability to vertical scroll 
                        through different categories. Additionally, we thought 
                        of adding some kind of social aspect, similar to stories 
                        on Instagram or Snapchat, where users can post pictures 
                        from events.

                        Additionally, you can see what different homepages
                        would look like depending on the number of invites and 
                        upcoming events a user has.

                                We implemented an Apple Wallet display of events, 
                                where the events are stacked on top of each other
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                For incoming events, the user can swipe left/right 
                                to show if they are attending or not
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The user can scroll vertically to see upcoming 
                                events and past events

                                The user can click on "Trends" to navigate to 
                                the "Trends" page where they will find party 
                                themes, resturants/food, and venues
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The user can click on the "Friends" page to 
                                navigate to users' highlights where a user can 
                                click on the highlight and see a polariod picture 
                                post from the party

                                The user can return to the "Friends" page to see 
                                their friends and suggested users

                        After completing our Hi-Fi design, we sent a Loom video 
                        of our design and got to meet with the product designers 
                        of Partiful as well to show what we produced based on the 
                        feedback and multiple iterations that we thought of. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The feedback we received was very positive. They liked 
                        the design we created and thought it was a significant 
                        improvement over their current homepage. They also 
                        provided us with some suggestions for further 
                        improvement, which we will incorporate into our 
                        final design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are some of the key points from the feedback we received:
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>They liked the Apple Wallet style of viewing the events</li>
                            <li>All of the points of feedback and criteria to hit were answered in the Hi-Fi</li>
                            <li>Interactions should be generalized where a swiping motion should signify only one of reorganization or stating "Going"</li>
                            <li>The Apple Wallet should also have an interaction to open up to see all the events at once instead of it being stacked which will help accesibility.</li>
                            <li>In the trends tab, the content should be geared more towards getting inspiration to help hosts.</li>
                            <li>In the friends tab, more of an activity page seeing people going to parties isntead of just seeing what people there are</li>
                            <li>They loved the polaroid picture UI in the friends tab as well as the highlights section.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All the feedback was really helpful in identifying which direction to take the design and help thorough out the next steps in making this a fully thought out design.

                                The importance of iterative design and how it can help us create a better product

                      Some things we could consider if we continued to process 
                      in the future would be creating the "Trends" page to be 
                      more geared towards helping hosts plan events. This could 
                      look like creating some kind of Tinder-like swiping 
                      feature for users to swipe through and "like" themes, 
                      food options, and venues for events.

                        I want to give <b>many thanks</b> to the Partiful team for 
                        giving us the opportunity to work with them and for 
                        providing us with valuable feedback throughout the 
                        design process.
