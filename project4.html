                        During the fall semester in 2023, I got the unique opportunity 
                        to become a Data Science Fellow at Brown University, where 
                        I was paired with two professors, Dr. Liz Chen and Dr. Neil Sarkar, 
                        to help integrate data science into their course Methods in Informatics and 
                        Data Science for Health in the Brown Center for Biomedical Informatics. This semester long project allowed 
                        me to create a couple of guides for their students to use to 
                        understand how to read and access health data and how to perform basic analysis on the data.

                        For the course Methods in Informatics and 
                        Data Science for Health, there is a broad range of students 
                        taking the class. Some students have a lot of programming 
                        experience, and others have never coded before. As someone 
                        who was new to coding my sophomore year of college, I 
                        went through the learning process on using Github and creating
                        simple programs, to doing complex machine learning analysis. 
                        I was tasked to make guidebooks on the following topics 
                        for people of all coding backgrounds, especially those 
                        who have never coded before, using what I learned from 
                        my experiences learning to code:

                            <li>

                        This project was structured by creating two-three week long 
                        sprints throughout the semester to complete, coupled with weekly check in 
                        meetings to give feedback, ask for advice, and share my work.

                        all different skill levels. I also learned that I really enjoyed
